In general, project development will look something like:

* Initialization
	- define project and its goals
	- outline project requirements
	- organize rough development schedule
	- conduct initial analysis and planning
	- outline basic prototype requirements

* Prototype (1)
	- build a minimal working prototype that implements requirements defined during intialization

* Testing 1
	- testing of prototype's functionality to ensure it works properly, but also
	- basic performance testing of prototype to support continuation of project's development

* Revisions 1
	- outline set of minor revisions that should be made to the prototype based on previous rounds of testing
	- outline set of feature additions and/or enhancements to implement in the prototype for next round(s) of testing

* Repeat Prototype->Testing->Revisions until jump from prototype to Release is minimal
	- focus on ensuring most important requirements/features are conceptualized in the prototype so that biggest issues can be worked out prior to release

* Pre First Release
	- outline any final revisions/additions/enhancements that need to be made to current prototype to ensure it's releaseable
	- perform revisions/additions/enhancements
	- test revisions/additions/enhancements; repeat from previous step as necessary
	- determine any other steps required for smooth release

* First Release
	- perform any bug fixes to release, as necessary
	
* Post First Release
	- begin outlining set of minor revisions/additions/enhancements to be made to current release for next release
	- begin performing outlined revisions/additions/enhancements

* Repeat Pre Release->Release->Post Release cycle over project's lifespan
